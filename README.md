# scan_and_plan

A curated listing of useful tools for dynamically programming robots in ROS based on perception data.

If you have a thought or suggestion, please contribute! My experience is pretty limited to work with ROS-Industrial, so I'd love to hear from other corners of the open source world.

** I would love to hear from some folks with experience with open-source CAM software! **
